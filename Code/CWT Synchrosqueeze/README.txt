TOOLBOX of ASST_v1



1. This is a collection of Matlab routines developed for the adaptive CWT, adaptive SST and 2nd-order adaptive SST described in [1].


2. List of functions included:


MAIN ROUTINES:

MAIN - This is an example for the two-component LFM signal

RENYI_ENTROPY - Find the time-varying sigma by Renyi entropy

CWT_MC_TI - Computes the CWT Ws for a fixed time ti

BOUNDARY_CWT - Calculate the boundaries of multicomponent on the CWT plane;

IMAGESQ - Displays time-frequency result of the Synchrosqueezing transform

CWT_SST_MC_TI - Computes the CWT Ws, the phase transform of CWT Rs, and the  synchrosqueezing transform SST Ts of the signal s.

CWT_SST_MC - Computes the CWT Ws, the phase transform of CWT Rs, and the  synchrosqueezing transform SST Ts of the signal s.

RENYI_ENTROPY_GLOBAL - Computes concentration of a time-frquency distribution.

CWT_2ND_ORDER_SST_TV - Computes the ADAPTIVE Continuous Wavelet transform: Ws, the ADAPTIVE 1st-order time-varying synchrosqueezing transform: Ts1_vt; the ADAPTIVE 2nd-order time-varying synchrosqueezing transform: Ts2_vt   and the phase transform w2nd.

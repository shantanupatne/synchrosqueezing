  
TOOLBOX of adaptive_FSST_v1

   1. This is a collection of Matlab routines developed for the adaptive STFT, adaptive FSST and 2nd-order adaptive FSST described in [1], and the entropy-based adaptive FSST with regular phase transformation in [2].


   2. List of functions included:

    MAIN ROUTINES:

    MAIN - This is an example for the two-component LFM signal

    ADAP_STFT_SST - Computes the adaptive STFT, the adaptive FSST

    STFT_SST2 - Computes STFT, FSST and VSST (2nd-order conventional FSST) of a signal using a Gaussian window
     
    REGULAR_PT_ADAP_SST- Computes the regular-phase-transform-based adaptive FSST in [2]

    REGULAR_PT_ADAP_SST2 - Computes the regular-phase-transform-based 2nd-order adaptive FSST in [2] 
      
    
    MAJOR ROUTINES:

    Renyi_STFT_SST - Finds the time-varying sigma by Renyi entropy

    IMAGESQ - Displays time-frequency result of the synchrosqueezing transform
    
    Renyi_ENTROPY_GLOBAL - Computes concentration of a time-frequency distribution.

    STFT_TI - Computes the STFT for fixed sigma and t 

    CH_RA_ESTI - Estimates the chirp rate of a component

    LOCAL_MAX - Finds the local maxima


  3. ACKNOWNLEGEMENT: We used the codes for the 2nd-order conventional FSST (called VSST) from the toolbox FSSTn-master in our STFT_SST2. We thank Duong Hung PHAM and Sylvain Meignen for their toolbox FSSTn-master.
